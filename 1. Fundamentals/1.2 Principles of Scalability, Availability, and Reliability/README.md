## **1.2 Principles of Scalability, Availability, and Reliability**

- **Purpose**: Learn core principles that guide the design of robust systems.
- **Chapters**:
    1. **Scalability**
        - Vertical scaling vs horizontal scaling.
        - Stateless vs stateful architectures.
        - Examples of scalable designs (e.g., distributed databases).
    2. **Availability**
        - Definitions: Availability vs uptime.
        - Designing for high availability (HA).
        - Redundancy and failover mechanisms.
    3. **Reliability**
        - Reliability vs availability.
        - Fault tolerance and graceful degradation.
        - Techniques for improving reliability (e.g., retries, idempotency).
    4. **Trade-offs Between Scalability, Availability, and Reliability**
        - How to balance trade-offs based on requirements.
        - Real-world examples of trade-offs.
