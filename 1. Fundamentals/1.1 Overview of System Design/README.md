- **Purpose**: Understand what system design is and its importance in solving real-world engineering problems.
- **Chapters**:
    1. **Introduction to System Design**
        - What is system design?
        - Difference between high-level and low-level design.
        - Examples of real-world systems (e.g., e-commerce, social media platforms).
    2. **Why System Design Matters**
        - Impact on scalability, reliability, and maintainability.
        - Role of system design in interviews and real-world projects.
    3. **System Design Process**
        - Gathering requirements.
        - Defining key use cases and constraints.
        - Designing high-level architecture and low-level components.
    4. **Types of System Design**
        - Designing web applications vs distributed systems.
        - Real-time systems vs batch systems.
        - Offline-first systems vs always-online systems.
