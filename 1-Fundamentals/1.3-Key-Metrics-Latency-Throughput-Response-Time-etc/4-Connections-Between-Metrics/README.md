## **Connections Between Metrics**

System performance is evaluated using various metrics, including **latency**, **throughput**, and **response time**, among others. These metrics are interconnected, and improving one often impacts the others. Understanding their relationships helps in designing systems that align with specific requirements.

----------

### **1. Interaction Between Latency and Throughput**

#### **Definitions Recap**

-   **Latency**: The time taken to process a single request.
-   **Throughput**: The total number of requests a system can handle per unit time.

#### **Relationship**

-   **Inverse Relationship**: In general, higher throughput can lead to higher latency and vice versa.
    -   Example: A database under heavy load might have high throughput (handling many requests per second) but increased latency for individual queries.
-   **Queuing Effects**: As throughput approaches the system's capacity, requests may queue up, increasing latency.

#### **Balancing the Two**

-   **Low Latency**: Prioritize for real-time applications (e.g., gaming, financial trading) where responsiveness is critical.
-   **High Throughput**: Prioritize for batch processing or analytics systems where the total volume of data processed is more important than individual request speeds.
-   **Trade-off Example**:
    -   A streaming platform like Netflix must optimize for both:
        -   **Low latency**: To ensure quick video start times.
        -   **High throughput**: To serve millions of concurrent users.

----------

### **2. Choosing the Right Metrics Based on System Requirements**

#### **Key Considerations**

-   The system's **primary use case**.
-   The **trade-offs** acceptable for your application.
-   The **load** and **user expectations** for performance.

### **3. Techniques for Optimizing Both Metrics**

#### **Improving Throughput Without Sacrificing Latency**

-   **Asynchronous Processing**: Offload non-critical tasks to background workers.
    -   Example: Logging user actions asynchronously instead of in the request-response cycle.
-   **Batching**: Combine multiple small operations into one.
    -   Example: Bulk inserts into a database.
-   **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across multiple servers to avoid bottlenecks.

#### **Reducing Latency Without Sacrificing Throughput**

-   **Caching**: Reduce computational overhead by storing results of frequent operations.
    -   Example: Cache database query results in Redis.
-   **Optimized Data Paths**: Minimize hops between services or databases.
    -   Example: Use a direct read replica for queries rather than routing through multiple layers.
-   **CDNs**: Use content delivery networks to serve static resources closer to users.

----------

### **4. Real-World Examples of Interactions**

#### **Example 1: Web Servers**

-   **High Throughput Goal**: A web server configured to handle many concurrent requests may batch operations, slightly increasing latency for individual users.
-   **Latency Optimization**: A server prioritizing low latency may allocate more resources per request, limiting throughput.

#### **Example 2: Streaming Platforms**

-   **Latency**: Ensure quick buffering and playback start for users.
-   **Throughput**: Maintain high-quality video streams for millions of concurrent viewers.
-   **Solution**: Adaptive bitrate streaming balances video quality (throughput) with low buffering times (latency).

----------

### **5. General Principles for Balancing Metrics**

-   **Define SLAs**: Establish clear Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for latency and throughput based on user expectations.
-   **Monitor Metrics in Real Time**: Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog to track metrics and identify bottlenecks.
-   **Capacity Planning**: Design the system to handle peak loads while maintaining acceptable latency.
-   **Dynamic Scaling**: Use auto-scaling to handle throughput spikes without degrading latency.
