## **1.3 Key Metrics: Latency, Throughput, Response Time, etc.**

- **Purpose**: Understand key performance metrics for evaluating system efficiency.
- **Chapters**:
    1. **Latency**
        - Network latency vs application latency.
        - Sources of latency in distributed systems.
        - Techniques for reducing latency (e.g., caching, CDN).
    2. **Throughput**
        - Definition and measurement.
        - Maximizing throughput with parallel processing and batching.
    3. **Response Time**
        - Average response time vs percentile response times (e.g., P99).
        - How to optimize response times.
    4. **Connections Between Metrics**
        - How latency and throughput interact.
        - Choosing the right metrics based on system requirements.
    5. **Hands-On Exercises**
        - Simulate latency and throughput scenarios (e.g., HTTP requests under load).
        - Use tools like Apache JMeter or k6 for load testing.
