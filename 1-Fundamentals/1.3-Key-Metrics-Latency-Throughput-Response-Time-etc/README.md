## **1.3 Key Metrics: Latency, Throughput, Response Time, etc.**

- **Purpose**: Understand key performance metrics for evaluating system efficiency.
- **Chapters**:
    1. **[Latency](./1-Latency/README.md)**
            - Network latency vs application latency.
            - Sources of latency in distributed systems.
            - Techniques for reducing latency (e.g., caching, CDN).
    2. **[Throughput](./2-Throughput/README.md)**
        - Definition and measurement.
        - Maximizing throughput with parallel processing and batching.
    3. **[Response Time](./3-Response-Time/README.md)**
        - Average response time vs percentile response times (e.g., P99).
        - How to optimize response times.
    4. **[Connections Between Metrics](./4-Connections-Between-Metrics/README.md)**
        - How latency and throughput interact.
        - Choosing the right metrics based on system requirements.
    5. **[Hands-On Exercises](./5-Hands-On-Exercises/README.md)**
        - Simulate latency and throughput scenarios (e.g., HTTP requests under load).
        - Use tools like Apache JMeter or k6 for load testing.
