## **Hands-On Exercises: Understanding PACELC Through Practical Simulations**

To truly grasp the concepts of **CAP Theorem** and **PACELC**, nothing beats hands-on experience. In this section, we’ll focus on practical exercises to simulate partitioned systems and explore the trade-offs between **availability**, **consistency**, and **latency** in distributed systems.

----------

### **Exercise 1: Simulate a Partitioned System**

This exercise will help you experience the trade-offs between **availability** and **consistency** during network partitions.

#### **Objective**

Build a simple system where:

-   Data is replicated across multiple servers.
-   A network partition occurs, and you must choose between **consistency** and **availability**.

#### **Tools Needed**

-   **Languages**: Python, Node.js, or any programming language you’re comfortable with.
-   **Libraries**:
    -   Python: `Flask` for APIs and `socket` for simulating communication.
    -   Node.js: `Express.js` for APIs and `ws` for WebSocket communication.

#### **Steps to Implement**

1.  **Set Up a Simple Distributed System**
    
    -   Create two servers (e.g., Server A and Server B) that replicate data between each other.
    -   Each server should have an endpoint to store and fetch data (e.g., `/write` and `/read`).
2.  **Simulate Data Replication**
    
    -   Write a script to ensure that whenever data is written to one server, it’s automatically sent to the other for consistency.
3.  **Introduce a Network Partition**
    
    -   Add logic to simulate a network partition where Server A and Server B can’t communicate.
4.  **Experiment with Trade-Offs**
    
    -   **Consistency Mode**:  
        When a client writes data to Server A during the partition, reject the request unless Server B can also receive the update.
        -   Result: System ensures consistency but sacrifices availability.
    -   **Availability Mode**:  
        Allow Server A to process writes independently of Server B during the partition.
        -   Result: System remains available, but consistency is sacrificed (Server B may have outdated data).

#### **Expected Outcome**

By testing both modes, you’ll see how **consistency** and **availability** impact the system’s behavior during partitions.

### **Exercise 2: Discuss PACELC with Popular Systems**

PACELC goes beyond CAP by introducing the trade-off between **latency** and **consistency** during normal operations. Let’s analyze popular distributed systems in the context of PACELC.

#### **Objective**

Understand how systems like DynamoDB and Cassandra handle **partition tolerance**, **availability**, **consistency**, **latency**, and trade-offs in their designs.

----------

#### **Case Study: Amazon DynamoDB**

1.  **Overview**  
    DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that prioritizes **availability** during network partitions (AP in CAP).
    
2.  **Trade-Offs During Partition (PA)**
    
    -   DynamoDB chooses **availability**:  
        When a partition occurs, DynamoDB allows updates to be processed independently, even if not all replicas are synchronized immediately.  
        This ensures the system stays available but sacrifices **consistency**.
3.  **Else Condition (ELC)**
    
    -   During normal operations, DynamoDB allows you to choose between:
        -   **Eventual Consistency**: Faster responses but with potential delays in data synchronization.
        -   **Strong Consistency**: Slower responses but guarantees all replicas are updated before returning a result.
4.  **Hands-On Exercise for DynamoDB**
    
    -   Use AWS DynamoDB to create a sample database.
    -   Perform a write operation with both consistency modes:
        -   **Eventual Consistency**: Write data and immediately fetch it from a different region. Notice that the data might not be updated instantly.
        -   **Strong Consistency**: Use DynamoDB’s strong consistency option and observe how the latency increases to ensure accuracy.

----------

#### **Case Study: Apache Cassandra**

1.  **Overview**  
    Cassandra is a highly available NoSQL database that prioritizes **availability** during partitions (AP in CAP).
    
2.  **Trade-Offs During Partition (PA)**
    
    -   Cassandra ensures **availability** by allowing writes to proceed even if some replicas are unreachable.
    -   However, you can configure its consistency level (e.g., `ONE`, `QUORUM`, or `ALL`) to adjust the balance between consistency and availability.
3.  **Else Condition (ELC)**
    
    -   Cassandra trades **latency** for **consistency** during normal operations.
    -   Developers can choose consistency levels:
        -   **ONE**: Fastest but with less consistency.
        -   **QUORUM**: A middle-ground option balancing latency and consistency.
        -   **ALL**: Slowest but ensures all replicas are consistent.
4.  **Hands-On Exercise for Cassandra**
    
    -   Install Apache Cassandra locally or use a cloud provider.
    -   Configure a cluster with 3 nodes and perform the following:
        -   Write data with `consistency=ONE`. Notice how the write is accepted even if only one node responds.
        -   Write data with `consistency=ALL`. Observe how the latency increases, but all replicas are updated.

----------

### **Exercise 3: Simulating Latency vs. Consistency Trade-Off**

This exercise will help you understand how latency and consistency are related in distributed systems.

#### **Objective**

Build a system that demonstrates:

-   Faster responses when allowing relaxed consistency.
-   Slower responses when ensuring strong consistency.

#### **Tools Needed**

-   A key-value store (e.g., Redis, MongoDB) for data storage.
-   A simulated network delay using tools like `tc` (Linux) or libraries like `toxiproxy`.

#### **Steps to Implement**

1.  **Set Up a Key-Value Store**
    
    -   Use a database like Redis or MongoDB to store simple key-value pairs.
2.  **Simulate a Latency-Consistent System**
    
    -   Configure a distributed setup with two database nodes replicating data.
    -   Write a script that performs reads and writes with:
        -   **Relaxed Consistency**: Respond immediately after writing to one node.
        -   **Strong Consistency**: Wait for confirmation that all nodes have updated before responding.
3.  **Measure Latency**
    
    -   Use a timer to measure how long each operation takes under both modes.
    -   Observe the trade-off between faster responses and consistent data.

#### **Expected Outcome**

You’ll see how prioritizing consistency can slow down a system, while prioritizing latency might allow users to see slightly outdated data.
