## **4. CAP Theorem and PACELC Theorem**

1.  **[CAP Trade-offs](./cap-trade-offs.md)**:
    -   Set up a distributed key-value store (e.g., Consul or Etcd).
    -   Simulate network partitions and observe behavior when prioritizing consistency vs availability.
2.  **[PACELC Exploration](./pacelc-exploration.md)**:
    -   Use a NoSQL database like DynamoDB or MongoDB to demonstrate latency vs consistency trade-offs.
    -   Write a report comparing latency in strongly consistent and eventually consistent reads.
3.  **[Visualization](./visualization.md)**:
    -   Create diagrams illustrating scenarios where CAP and PACELC apply.
    -   Include real-world examples of systems (e.g., DynamoDB for AP, Spanner for CP).
