## **Overview of System Design**

1.  **[Gathering Requirements](./gathering-requirements.md)**:
    -   Define functional and non-functional requirements for a simple system like a URL shortener.
    -   Identify constraints such as data storage, scalability, and high availability.
2.  **[Design High-Level Architecture](./design-high-level-architecture.md)**:
    -   Use tools like [draw.io](http://draw.io) or Lucidchart to create a high-level architecture diagram for the system.
    -   Include components such as frontend, backend, database, and caching layer.
3.  **[Explore Trade-offs](./explore-trade-offs.md)**:
    -   Discuss trade-offs in choosing a relational database vs a NoSQL database for the system.
    -   Create a document explaining decisions made based on scalability and consistency requirements.
