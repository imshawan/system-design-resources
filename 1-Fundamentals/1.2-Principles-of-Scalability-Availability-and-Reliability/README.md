## **1.2 Principles of Scalability, Availability, and Reliability**

- **Purpose**: Learn core principles that guide the design of robust systems.
- **Chapters**:
    1. **[Scalability](1-Fundamentals/1.2-Principles-of-Scalability-Availability-and-Reliability/1-Scalability/README.md)**
            - Vertical scaling vs horizontal scaling.
            - Stateless vs stateful architectures.
            - Examples of scalable designs (e.g., distributed databases).
    2. **[Availability](1-Fundamentals/1.2-Principles-of-Scalability-Availability-and-Reliability/2-Availability/README.md)**
        - Definitions: Availability vs uptime.
        - Designing for high availability (HA).
        - Redundancy and failover mechanisms.
    3. **[Reliability](1-Fundamentals/1.2-Principles-of-Scalability-Availability-and-Reliability/3-Reliability/README.md)**
        - Reliability vs availability.
        - Fault tolerance and graceful degradation.
        - Techniques for improving reliability (e.g., retries, idempotency).
    4. **[Trade-offs Between Scalability, Availability, and Reliability](1-Fundamentals/1.2-Principles-of-Scalability-Availability-and-Reliability/4-Trade-offs/README.md)**
        - How to balance trade-offs based on requirements.
        - Real-world examples of trade-offs.
